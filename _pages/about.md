I'm a first year PhD Student at the University of California, Berkeley. In the coming years, I will look to use this website as a way of showcasing the work that I've done. My research will broadly focus on understanding Transport Phenomena in biological systems.

Before starting graduate school at Berkeley, I obtained a BSc in Chemical Engineering and a BSc in Pure and Applied Mathematics from the University of Calgary. I am continuing my study of mathematics in graduate school, and will write about topics in mathetmaics that pique my interest on here from time to time.
