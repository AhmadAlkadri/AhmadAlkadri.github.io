I work at the intersection of applied mathematics, computation, and modelling. I completed my PhD at UC Berkeley, where my research spanned continuum mechanics, quantum algorithms for scientific computing, and numerical methods for partial differential equations. 

I’m driven by a long-standing curiosity about how mathematical structure can illuminate complex systems—whether in physical modelling or data-driven environments. This website collects some of my work, writing, and ongoing projects.
